Our methods of testing first consisted of individually printing out every instruction that runs for each function which include decode, etc. This also inlcuded
making sure that our values were being updated when needed and in the proper format. After completing the required functions we also began to test the sample.dump file
via the ./sim sample.dump and comparing our output to the sample.output. Following that procedure we went on and tested our own sample.dump in sample2 which 
basically testing some our functions such as addiu, lui, ori, etc. To finish testing the rest of our tests we also tested with q, i, and the rest of the 
interactive commands.
